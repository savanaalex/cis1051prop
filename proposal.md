# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

"The Sandworm on Saturn"
## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A Beetlejuice themed game of Snake except the snake will have added obstacles. 
## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

The software will play out a game of Snake where the user guides snake to eat food in order to grow longer but the snake cannot run into its own tail or it will die. I will customize the game to resemble my favorite scene in Beetlejuice and I will also add obstacles that can 'poison' the snake as an extra challenge. The game will end once the snake takes up the entire board or when the player reaches a certain score. I will excecute it using Love.  
## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

TODO, if applicable

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

A basic working working game of snake with no added obstacles without the Beetlejuice theme.
### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Snake but with the added obstables and a score keeper. 
### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Snake with the added obstacles, score keeper and the Beetlejuice theme.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

First I am going to learn how to code in the language needed for Love. Afterwards I will go step by step in trying to get each goals accomplished, for example making a plain extremely version of Snake and then adding my own ideas little by little. I will need to research how to play Snake and the official rules of the game so I can use them to make my own version.
